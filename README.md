This project aims to take a CSV extract of the option prices and output an implied Probability Density Function from the option prices.

The method used for this project is described in the file below.

Using bids and asks marks in the CSV file, we can easily price our butterflies. If this data doesn't give enough accuracy, I will calibrate a SABR stochastic volatility model to price options.

I am still far from finished with this project, but wanted to make an initial commit.
